explain the working of this code

This code performs a comprehensive quality assessment analysis for a Net Banking Application using various performance metrics collected over 10 weeks. Let me explain how it works:

Data Creation and Setup
The code starts by importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats) and setting plot styling preferences.
It creates a sample dataset with 10 weeks of simulated quality metrics including:
Transaction success rate
System availability
Response time
Transaction throughput
Mean time between failures (MTBF)
Error rates
Defect metrics
Mean time to repair (MTTR)
Exploratory Analysis
The code displays the first few rows of the dataset and calculates descriptive statistics for all metrics.
It then performs correlation analysis to identify relationships between different metrics, filtering to show only strong correlations (above 0.5).
Trend Analysis
The analyze_trend() function uses linear regression to determine if metrics are improving or degrading over time.
For each key metric, it calculates:
Slope (direction and magnitude of change)
p-value (statistical significance)
R-squared (strength of trend)
Overall trend (improving or degrading)
Note: It intelligently determines if "improving" means an increase or decrease based on the metric (e.g., decreasing response time is good)
Impact Analysis
The code uses correlation with Transaction Success Rate as a proxy for overall quality impact.
It ranks metrics by their correlation strength to identify which factors most strongly influence overall quality.
Quality Compliance Analysis
The code defines target thresholds for key metrics (e.g., Transaction Success Rate should be â‰¥ 99%).
It evaluates each week's data against these thresholds to determine if quality targets were met.
It calculates the percentage of weeks that met each target.
Statistical Testing
The code compares the first half of the dataset with the second half using t-tests.
This helps identify if there are statistically significant changes in performance over time.
Anomaly Detection
Using z-scores, the code identifies potential outliers in the data.
It flags weeks where metrics deviate significantly from normal ranges.
Visualizations
The code creates several visualizations:

Time series plots showing how key metrics change over the 10 weeks
A correlation heatmap showing relationships between metrics
Bar charts showing compliance with quality targets
A radar chart displaying the quality profile of the most recent week
Comparisons of actual metrics against thresholds
A visualization of metrics with the highest impact on quality
Summary Insights
Finally, the code prints summary insights including:

Metrics with the highest impact on overall quality
Key quality trends (improving or degrading)
Compliance status for each metric against defined thresholds
This analysis would help banking application managers identify quality issues, understand trends, prioritize improvements, and track compliance with quality standards.

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KlVLKhI0QBjn6PWISzGDM7LJJGhCj4q8?usp=sharing - create a UI for this project which allows the user to upload a image, the algorithm must predict the result and display it on the website (use streamlit for UI) I would like to do this project on vs code, so give the code files along with the project structure or directory

I'll help you create a Streamlit UI for this project that allows users to upload images for prediction. Let me design the code structure for VS Code implementation.


Project Structure
Code 
Now, let me provide each file with the appropriate code:


app.py - Main Streamlit Application
Code 

model.py - Model Loading and Prediction Functions
Code 

utils.py - Utility Functions for Image Processing
Code 

requirements.txt - Dependencies
Code 

README.md - Project Documentation
Code 

.gitignore - Git Ignore File
Code 
How to Use This Project
To run this Streamlit application on your local machine, follow these steps:

Set up your project directory:
Create a new directory for your project
Add all the files provided above with their exact names
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update the model information:
Extract the model URL from your Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KlVLKhI0QBjn6PWISzGDM7LJJGhCj4q8?usp=sharing)
Update the gdrive_url variable in model.py with your model's Google Drive ID
Update the CLASS_LABELS list with your actual class labels
Run the application:
streamlit run app.py
Use the application:
Upload an image using the file uploader
Click the "Predict" button to get predictions
View the results as text and a bar chart
Customization Points
Model-specific customizations:
You may need to adjust the preprocess_image function in utils.py to match how your model was trained
Update the prediction handling in model.py if you're using a different type of model (e.g., object detection)
UI customizations:
The Streamlit interface can be expanded with additional features like confidence threshold adjustment
You can add more visualization options for the results
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code in more detail?
